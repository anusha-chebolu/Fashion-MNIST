# Fashion-MNIST

ðŸ‘• Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. it was intend for Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

Summary
Representing the images in 3 ways
Pixel features representation (28Ã—28) 784 pixel with a column for the label
HOG features representation 70 features
PCA 40 features
Mix dataset between HOG and PCA
Building Logistic Regression on each dataset Model hypertuning using GridSearch , Cross validation
Kmeans (removing the label from the subset of dataset contain only 5 classses)
Visualising K-means using PCA to create 3 components can be plotted as a 3D clusters
